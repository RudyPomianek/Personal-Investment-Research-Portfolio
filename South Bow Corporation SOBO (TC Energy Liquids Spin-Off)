# South Bow Corporation SOBO
(TC Energy Liquids Spin-Off)
### Public Analysis — Watchlist, Not a Buy

## Investment Conclusion (Read This First)

**Conclusion: NOT A BUY (Yet).**

South Bow is a legitimate spin-off with the *potential* to become mispriced, but today it does **not** offer sufficient asymmetry to justify a position.  
This analysis is written to answer one question only:

> *Do I want to buy this spinoff today?*

**Answer:** No — and the sections below explain why.

---

## Business Overview & Spin-Off Context

South Bow became an independent company on **October 1, 2024**, following the separation of TC Energy’s Liquids Pipelines business. The company owns and operates crude oil pipeline infrastructure, anchored by the **Keystone system**, along with associated liquids assets.

The parent’s motivation for the spin was straightforward:  
**reduce leverage and refocus TC Energy on regulated natural gas infrastructure.**

To achieve this, South Bow was **levered at birth**, with approximately **C$7.9B of debt** placed at the spin. Proceeds were used to repay TC Energy, effectively transferring leverage to the new entity.

This immediately changed the risk profile for inherited shareholders.

## Why This *Could* Have Been a Classic Spinoff Opportunity

Spin-offs can create opportunity when three things align:

1. The parent wants the asset gone  
2. The shareholder base is mismatched  
3. The market temporarily misprices the new entity  

South Bow checks **some**, but not all, of these boxes.

### Parent Motive
✔ TC Energy clearly wanted to delever  
✔ Liquids pipelines were non-core to the parent’s future strategy  

### Shareholder Mismatch
✔ Income-oriented TC Energy holders received a levered liquids pure-play  
✔ Distribution ratio (0.2 shares per TC Energy share) created many “stub” positions  

### Missing Piece
✘ No clear evidence yet of **capitulation-level forced selling** or neglect  

This is why the setup is *interesting*, but incomplete.

## Ownership & Forced-Selling Assessment

South Bow inherited shareholders who largely **did not sign up** for:

- A single-sector crude oil pipeline company  
- Elevated leverage  
- Regulatory and incident-driven headline risk (Keystone)  

That *suggests* non-economic selling likely occurred.

However, at present:
- There is no clear evidence of panic selling  
- The stock does not appear orphaned  
- Valuation does not imply distress or abandonment  

**Interpretation:**  
The market is pricing *real risks*, not ignoring the company.

That weakens the buy case.

## Management Quality & Incentive Alignment

Management continuity is strong. The same executives who operated the liquids business inside TC Energy now run South Bow. This supports operational stability.

Compensation structure reinforces that mindset:

| Incentive Type | What It Rewards |
|---------------|----------------|
| Annual bonus | Safety, system reliability, EBITDA |
| Long-term equity | 3-year performance + TSR |
| Vesting | Multi-year, cliff-based |

**Key takeaway:**  
Management is incentivized to **avoid mistakes**, preserve asset integrity, and de-lever steadily — not to chase aggressive growth.

This is appropriate for the business, but it also limits near-term upside.

## Earnings Call Mentality: Reading Between the Lines

The purpose of reviewing earnings calls is **not** to quote management or accept guidance at face value.  
The goal is to identify **recurring stress points** and infer what management is most worried about.

### What Dominates the Calls

**Keystone integrity and regulatory oversight**  
Management repeatedly emphasizes safety, inspections, remediation timelines, and regulatory coordination. Answers here are careful and procedural — a sign this is the dominant tail risk.

**Leverage and balance-sheet control**  
Frequent references to net debt targets and deleveraging timelines suggest equity value is expected to come from *time and execution*, not growth.

**Standalone execution risk**  
Ongoing discussion of TSAs, ERP systems, and operational independence indicates management bandwidth is still partially consumed by separation work.

**Subtext:**  
Management is in **risk-containment mode**, not value-unlocking mode.

## Risk vs Reward Snapshot

### Current Risk Profile
- Regulatory and integrity tail risk (Keystone)  
- Elevated leverage  
- Limited near-term catalysts  
- Execution-heavy path to upside  

### Current Reward Profile
- Gradual deleveraging  
- Stable contracted cash flows  
- Potential re-rating *only if* risks recede
