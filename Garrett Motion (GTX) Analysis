# Garrett Motion (GTX)
Public Analysis — Active Watchlist: Post-Bankruptcy Spinoff with Operating Leverage

---

## Company Overview and Spinoff Timeline

Garrett Motion is a global manufacturer of turbochargers and related boosting technologies for internal combustion engines. The company serves OEM automotive customers and operates in both passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments.

Garrett was spun out of Honeywell in October 2018. Shortly after the spin, it was burdened with a controversial indemnification agreement tied to Honeywell’s asbestos liabilities. This, combined with auto-cycle weakness and leverage, pushed the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. It emerged from bankruptcy in April 2021 with a restructured balance sheet.

In the spinoff lifecycle, Garrett is well past forced selling and now in the **post-restructuring normalization phase**. Earnings power is visible and positive, but the market continues to discount the equity heavily due to structural concerns about internal combustion engine (ICE) decline.

This is not an early spin. It is a cleaned-up, stigmatized spin.

## Investment Conclusion

Garrett Motion is closer to a potential buy than most names we have reviewed, but it remains conditional.

The central investment question:

Is the market overestimating the speed and severity of internal combustion engine decline while underestimating Garrett’s cash flow durability?

The specific reason this is not yet a confident buy:

Long-term secular risk to ICE platforms creates uncertainty around terminal value, which limits valuation conviction.

However, this is the first situation where valuation compression may exceed realistic downside.

## Business Economics

Garrett manufactures turbochargers, which improve fuel efficiency and power output of internal combustion engines. As global emissions standards tighten, turbo penetration historically increased because automakers downsized engines and relied on boosting technology.

Economically:

- Revenue tied to global auto production volumes  
- Moderate cyclicality  
- Strong engineering relationships with OEMs  
- Meaningful operating leverage  

Margins can expand materially in upcycles due to fixed cost absorption. Cash conversion is historically solid once working capital normalizes.

This is not a growth business — it is a cash generative industrial business tied to auto production.

## Spin-Off Mechanics and Forced Selling

The original Honeywell spin created massive ownership mismatch.

Honeywell shareholders owned the parent for diversified industrial exposure and capital discipline. Garrett, as a standalone auto supplier with contingent liabilities, did not fit that mandate.

Post-spin, forced selling was compounded by:

- Liability confusion  
- Bankruptcy  
- Index removal  
- ESG-driven selling (ICE exposure)  

The shareholder base was completely reset through restructuring.

This is one of the clearest examples of prolonged non-economic selling we have reviewed.

## Where We Are in the Spinoff Profitability Timeline

Garrett is in the **post-distress normalization phase**.

Phase breakdown:

- 2018 spin → forced selling  
- 2020 bankruptcy → structural panic  
- 2021 emergence → balance sheet reset  
- Current phase → stable earnings, market skepticism  

Earnings are not forming. They are visible.

The market discount now reflects secular fear, not financial instability.

This is a more advanced stage opportunity than ZimVie or BLCO.

---

## Balance Sheet and Capital Structure

After restructuring, Garrett’s balance sheet is materially cleaner. Debt levels are manageable relative to EBITDA, and liquidity is stable.

The equity is no longer subordinate to existential financial risk.

This shifts the debate from survival to terminal value.

That is a major distinction.

---

## Management Quality and Incentives

Management communication post-restructuring has been disciplined and execution-focused. Capital allocation has emphasized balance sheet strength and selective investment in adjacent technologies, including electrification components.

There is no promotional pivot away from ICE. Management acknowledges secular transition but emphasizes long runway due to global vehicle fleet realities.

Tone is pragmatic rather than defensive.

---

## Earnings Call Psychology (Quarter-to-Quarter Tone)

Across recent quarters, several themes stand out:

First, management consistently frames the business as durable through mid-cycle volumes rather than dependent on aggressive growth. This signals confidence in baseline earnings.

Second, when analysts raise electrification risk, management does not dismiss it. Instead, they respond with penetration data and geographic mix, suggesting realism rather than denial.

Third, guidance language is steady and controlled. There is no desperation to change the narrative. This indicates internal confidence in earnings durability.

The subtext:

Management believes the business has a longer runway than the market implies.

That is a key potential edge.

---

## Valuation Framing

Garrett trades at a compressed multiple relative to industrial peers.

The discount reflects:

- ICE decline fears  
- Automotive cyclicality  
- Bankruptcy memory  

If earnings remain stable for several years, free cash flow could meaningfully exceed implied market expectations.

The asymmetry lies in the possibility that the decline narrative is overstated.

---

## Why This Is Not Yet a Full Buy

Garrett fails for one reason:

Terminal value uncertainty remains high due to long-term electrification trends.

If ICE demand falls faster than anticipated, long-term cash flow may deteriorate.

Without conviction on runway duration, valuation compression alone is insufficient.

---

## What Would Make This a Buy

Garrett becomes portfolio-worthy if:

- Two to three years of stable free cash flow demonstrate runway durability  
- Market continues to price terminal decline aggressively  
- Capital returns begin to accelerate  

That combination would create clear asymmetry.

---

## Final Verdict

Garrett Motion represents one of the most structurally interesting spinoff situations reviewed so far. It combines forced selling, balance sheet reset, operating leverage, and secular skepticism.

However, terminal value uncertainty prevents full conviction at this stage.
